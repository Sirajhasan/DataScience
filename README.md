# DataScience

First thing in the project was to import the downloaded dataset and pull up in Jupyter Notebook, importing neccessary python libraries for execution of project.
Next Step was to identify Features and labels.
Next Step was to split dataset into train-test split so that we can find accuracy.
Now I built Perceptron model and tune it with eta hyper-parameter on training data.
Predicting test
Last step was to finding Accuracy and misclassified samples
